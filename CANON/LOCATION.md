**Role in death:** Called 112 immediately, performed exactly as trained. Will write a thoughtful incident report.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Anna | Early shift, found the ambulance blocking her entrance |
| Security | None | Camera system handles it |
| Bar/Kitchen | Stefanie | WomBar manager, made the espressos that didn't help |
| Manager | Herr Schmidt | Will handle the paperwork perfectly, feel nothing |

### Staff Knowledge
The staff sees stress cases constantly. They've been trained to recognize medical emergencies. Max knew something was wrong but Rebecca insisted she was fine. German efficiency meets American denial.

## Hostel Atmosphere

Efficient preparation for efficient tourism. People planning, booking, organizing. Rebecca fit right in until she didn't.

### Night Vibe
WomBar brings life, but it's controlled. No chaos. Even the parties are somewhat organized. Rebecca approved.
